Exercise 2
==========

For this exercise we would like you to design a Money class and implement
a handful of test cases that exercise your design.  There are two files 
in this directory:

*Money.java*

- Implement your Money class in this file.  It is currently empty

*MoneyTest.java*

- fill out the implementation of the test methods that are defined
  in this class.  We have named various test methods that we would
  like you to implement to test out your class

You do not have to go through the trouble of actually installing TestNG and
running the test (this isn't an exercise in installing TestNG) - just write 
out the code.

Here are the minimum requirements we expect of your Money class:

- should represent dollars and cents (foreign currency is not required).
- should be able to perform comparisons with other Money instances.
- should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations on instances.
- should be able to take a Money instance and divide it by an integer.
  this should return an array of Money instances with the amounts of
  the allocations.
- should be able to return string representation such as: $12,512.00

You do not have to write code to parse Strings into Money objects, you
can create instances from integers representing dollars and/or cents.
