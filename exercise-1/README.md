Exercise 1
==========

Imagine that we store all of our historical application logs on a server in
a series of directories organized by application, with separate log files
per day.  For example:

    /logs
        /foo-app
            uiowa.foo-app.log.2010-12-31
            uiowa.foo-app.log.2011-01-01
            uiowa.foo-app.log.2011-01-02
            uiowa.foo-app.log.2011-01-03
            uiowa.foo-app.log.2011-01-04
            ... etc ...
        /bar-app
            uiowa.bar-app.log.2010-12-31
            uiowa.bar-app.log.2011-01-01
            uiowa.bar-app.log.2011-01-02
            uiowa.bar-app.log.2011-01-03
            uiowa.bar-app.log.2011-01-04
            ... etc ...
		
These log files are generated by the log4j library, contain only text, and
have log lines that typically look like this:

    2010-10-16 14:38:12,191 DEBUG uiowa.Category Some arbitrary log message...

Write an application that will read through all of the log files, looking for
strings that look like Social Security Numbers and replace them with "*"
characters, so if a log message looks like:

    A log message with SSN 999123456 did something

it should look like this after your program is run:

    A log message with SSN ********* did something

An example log file has been included in this directory.  While all of the
example SSN numbers are in SSN format, they are not real SSNs as they all 
start with 8 or 9.  Don't worry about whether the SSN is valid or not, mask
anything that looks like it could be a SSN.

You are free to use any technology to solve this problem.

Extra credit if you use something other than Java (as exercise 2 will 
require Java).
